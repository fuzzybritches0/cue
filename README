client and worker planer written in PHP

this was a project I started in 2010 for fun and in the hope that it would be useful. it never came to be used in production and hence has never been finished.

I invested a lot of time in this project and learned a lot. Especially how one should NOT DO things nowadays.

I then moved on to node and js.

implemented: simple db routines, user management, calendar planer, messaging, security measures of different kinds, ...
